10. This question relates to the College data set.

(a) Split the data into a training set and a test set. Using out-of-state
tuition as the response and the other variables as the predictors,
perform forward stepwise selection on the training set in order
to identify a satisfactory model that uses just a subset of the
predictors.

(b) Fit a GAM on the training data, using out-of-state tuition as
the response and the features selected in the previous step as
the predictors. Plot the results, and explain your findings.

(c) Evaluate the model obtained on the test set, and explain the
results obtained.

(d) For which variables, if any, is there evidence of a non-linear
relationship with the response?
